# course-app
Note: This is still a work in progress.Â 

I am planning to add: comments, discounts, and implementation with some payment methods...

# Applications contain 3 types of users: **User**, **Author**, and **Admin**. 

**Users** can buy courses, update courses or his account details and he can see which courses he owns, he also cannot buy the same course two times.

**Author** can add new courses, see a list of all courses he created and update courses or his account details.

**Admin** can create users with the Admin role, delete courses and look at all courses, but he cannot buy courses.
